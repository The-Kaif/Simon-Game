  <h1>How To Play Game<span class="abt">The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order,
      after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the device; there are actually other games on the original.

  <h2>Rule<ol class="abt">


    <li class="mar">Press the START button. Simon will give only the first signal.</li>

    <li class="mar">Repeat Simon's signal, and imme- diately add one. In this game, don't wait for Simon to repeat signals!</li>

    <li class="mar">Repeat the first two signals and add one more.</li>

    <li class="mar">Continue repeating the signals of the previous sequence and increas- ing that sequence by one. Try to reach the longest sequence of 31!</li>

    <li class="mar">If you make an error or take more than 5 seconds to play any signal, you'll hear the "RAZZ" sound. This means the game is over.</li>

    <li class="mar">Press the LAST button, and count the number of signals as it plays back the last (longest) sequence. This is your score.</li>

    <li class="mar">To play again, repeat Steps 2 through 7. If you make it to 31 signals, Simon will salute you with six short signals.</li>
